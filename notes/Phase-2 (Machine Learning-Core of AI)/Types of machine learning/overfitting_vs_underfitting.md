Overfitting vs Underfitting

🎯 Goal
Understand what overfitting and underfitting mean in Machine Learning
and how they affect model performance.


📘 Concept Explained Simply

When we train a machine learning model, our goal is:
Learn patterns from data and perform well on new, unseen data

But sometimes the model:
- Learns too little → Underfitting
- Learns too much → Overfitting

Both situations are problems.

🔵 What is Underfitting?

Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to learn the patterns
present in the data.

The model:
- Does not learn enough from training data
- Performs poorly on training data
- Performs poorly on testing data

📌 In short:  
👉 Model did not learn properly.


🔴 What is Overfitting?

Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well,
including noise and unnecessary details.

The model:
- Performs very well on training data
- Performs poorly on testing data

📌 In short:  
👉 Model memorized instead of learning.


🧠 Simple Real-Life Example

🎓 Studying for an Exam

- Underfitting:
  - You study very little
  - You don’t understand concepts
  - You fail both practice tests and final exam

- Overfitting:
  - You memorize answers to previous questions
  - You score high in practice tests
  - You fail when new questions appear in the exam

- Good Fit:
  - You understand concepts
  - You perform well on both practice and final exams
