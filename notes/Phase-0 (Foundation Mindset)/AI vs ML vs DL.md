# AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)
**Definition:**  
Artificial Intelligence is the broad field of creating machines that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Mimics human decision-making
- Can be rule-based or learning-based
- Does not always require data learning

**Examples:**
- Chess-playing programs
- Rule-based chatbots
- Expert systems

**Types of AI:**
- Narrow AI (Weak AI)
- General AI (AGI – theoretical)
- Super AI (theoretical)

## Machine Learning (ML)
**Definition:**  
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn patterns from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Data-driven learning
- Improves with experience
- Uses statistical and mathematical models

**Types of Machine Learning:**
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

**Examples:**
- Email spam detection
- Recommendation systems
- Credit score prediction

**Common Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Means Clustering

## Deep Learning (DL)
**Definition:**  
Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to model complex patterns in large datasets.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Uses artificial neural networks
- Requires large amounts of data
- High computational power needed (GPUs/TPUs)

**Neural Network Types:**
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Transformers

**Examples:**
- Image recognition
- Speech recognition
- Large Language Models (ChatGPT)
