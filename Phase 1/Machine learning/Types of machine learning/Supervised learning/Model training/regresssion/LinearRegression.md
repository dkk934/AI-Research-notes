### **Linear Regression in Machine Learning**

Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used for **predicting continuous values** based on given input features. It establishes a relationship between **independent variables (X)** and **dependent variable (Y)** using a straight-line equation:

\[
Y = mX + b
\]

where:
- \( Y \) = Predicted output (dependent variable)
- \( X \) = Input feature (independent variable)

- \( m \) is the **slope** (how steep the line is).
- \( b \) is the **bias (intercept)** (where the line crosses the Y-axis).

# **Example of Linear Regression**

Imagine we are trying to predict a student's final exam score based on the number of hours they studied.
  
| **Hours Studied (X)** | **Exam Score (Y)** |
|--------------------|----------------|
| 1                | 50             |
| 2                | 55             |
| 3                | 65             |
| 4                | 70             |
| 5                | 75             |
| 6                | 85             |

We can use **Linear Regression** to find the best-fit line that represents this data. Now, let's generate a **plot chart** for this dataset and visualize the linear regression line.

In the plot above:
- **Blue dots** represent actual data points (Hours Studied vs. Exam Score).
- **Red dashed line** is the **Linear Regression line**, which shows the trend.

### **How Linear Regression Works**
1. **Fitting the Line**: The algorithm finds the best straight line that minimizes the difference between actual and predicted values.
2. **Prediction**: Given an input \( X \), the model predicts \( Y \). For example:
   - If a student studies for **5.5 hours**, we can estimate their exam score using the equation:
     \[
     Y = mX + b
     \]
   - The model predicts their score to be around **80**.

### **Key Takeaways**
- Linear Regression is useful for predicting continuous values.
- It assumes a linear relationship between input \( X \) and output \( Y \).
- The regression line minimizes the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
