# AI Research Notes

## Description

This repository contains curated research notes, summaries, and practical experiments related to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). It is intended as a personal learning space to collect important ideas, references to papers, simple code snippets, and experiment logs while studying AI topics.

## Reason for this repository

Gaining basic knowledge about AI, machine learning, and related subfields; building a searchable, organized notebook of concepts, papers, and hands-on examples; and creating a reference that can be revisited and expanded over time.

Key goals:
- Learn foundational AI/ML concepts and algorithms
- Keep summaries of important research papers
- Record small experiments and reproducible code snippets
- Organize links and references for future study

Note: Adjust the structure to your needs — some folders may be empty initially.

## How to use

- Read notes in the `notes/` folder for quick conceptual overviews.
- Check `papers/` for short summaries and takeaways from research papers.
- Run examples from `code/` to reproduce small experiments or toy models.
- Add new files following the existing organization: topic-based notes in `notes/`, paper digests in `papers/`, and code in `code/`.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily for personal study, but feel free to open issues or pull requests if you'd like to suggest improvements or contribute additional notes and examples.
