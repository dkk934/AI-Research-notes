# AI Research Notes

## Description

This repository is created to help beginners understand the **basics of Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and provide a clear starting point for studying **AI, Machine Learning (ML), and Neural Networks**. It is designed as a simple, structured learning space where concepts are explained step by step, making it easier for anyone to begin their AI journey from scratch.

The goal is to present fundamental ideas, learning paths, and practical examples so that people can understand *what AI is*, *how it works*, and *how to start studying it effectively*.

## Reason for this repository

The purpose of this repository is to:

* Learn and explain foundational AI, ML, and Neural Network concepts in a beginner-friendly way
* Provide a structured roadmap for starting AI studies
* Maintain clear notes that can be revisited and expanded over time
* Collect useful references, examples, and small experiments for practice

This repository acts as a **learning notebook + guide** for anyone who wants to enter the field of AI.

## Key Goals

* Understand core AI concepts and terminology
* Learn Machine Learning algorithms and workflows
* Study Neural Networks and Deep Learning fundamentals
* Maintain concise summaries of topics and papers
* Record simple experiments and reproducible examples
